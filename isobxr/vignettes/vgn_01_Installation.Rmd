The [isobxr](https://ttacail.github.io/isobxr/) package is a set of R tools 
designed to perform and explore stable isotope box modelling 
of open or closed systems.
It provides a ready-to-use tool allowing users to 
develop and test isotopic box models of their system of interest. 
It allows the user to explore the behavior of these systems
in both static (*e.g.*, at steady state) or dynamic modes 
(*e.g.*, in reaction to a perturbation), 
build complex scenarios, and sweep the space of parameters in both static 
and dynamic modes.
