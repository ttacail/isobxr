The [isobxr](https://ttacail.github.io/isobxr/) package is a set of R tools designed to perform and explore stable isotope box
modelling of open or closed systems.
It allows users to develop and test isotopic box models of their system of interest, explore the behavior of these systems
in both static (*e.g.*, at steady state) or dynamic modes (*e.g.*, in reaction to a perturbation), build complex scenarios, 
as well as sweep the space of parameters in both static and dynamic modes.

## Installation

The **isobxr** is available as a source package from [GitHub](https://github.com/).

The installation process can be found [here](https://ttacail.github.io/isobxr_web/vgn_01_Installation.html).

## Principles and tutorials

The documentation about underlying theory and isobxr utilization is made fully available to user in the [package website](https://ttacail.github.io/isobxr_web/index.html).
