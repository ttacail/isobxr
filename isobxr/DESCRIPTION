Title: Stable isotope box modelling in R
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Theo", "Tacail", email = "theo.tacail@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A set of functions to run simple and composite box-models to describe the 
    dynamic or static distribution of stable isotopes in open 
    or closed systems. The package also allows the sweeping of many 
    parameters in both static and dynamic conditions. It also comes 
    with a post-run plotting interface built under shiny.
